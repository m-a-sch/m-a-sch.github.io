        Hi, <br /><br />
        I code mostly for fun, never with chatGPT nor any "AI" help, to pass time.
        <br /><br />
        My current languages are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL and Python but I have Rust in mind.
        <br /><br />
        My browser and laptop are NOT your computing resource, they can only be used with permission.
        <br /><br />
        My code, pictures and texts are open-source and sometimes publicly availalble which does not mean they are in the "public domain".
        <br /><br />
        Some time ago, people thought that an elephant would be different from a bird to share their ideas and frustrations about life. They most likely
            did not realise that all what could possibly be written was already written.
        <br /><br />
